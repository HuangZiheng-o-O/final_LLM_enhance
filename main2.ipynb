      "Sequence Explanation: ### Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Action\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initiate the Turn:**\n",
      "   - **Dynamic Movement:** Begin by pivoting on your heel, using your core to generate momentum. This movement should be fluid and swift, creating a dramatic flair.\n",
      "   - **Coordination:** Require synchronization between the feet (for balance), hips (to assist in turning), and shoulders (to follow the pivot).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Extend the Arm:**\n",
      "   - **Dynamic Movement:** As you complete the turn, extend your dominant arm outward in a gunpoint position. This should be a sharp, controlled motion that embodies confidence.\n",
      "   - **Coordination:** The shoulder must engage to raise the arm, while the elbow bends to bring the arm forward. The wrist should be straight to maintain the ‘gun’ position.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Plant the Feet:**\n",
      "   - **Dynamic Movement:** Stabilize your stance by planting your feet firmly shoulder-width apart. This grounding step should follow the turn for better balance.\n",
      "   - **Coordination:** Engage the leg muscles to support the body, using the toes and heels to establish a solid base. The entire lower body should work together to maintain equilibrium.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Align the Body:**\n",
      "   - **Dynamic Movement:** Shift your torso to face your target directly while keeping your arm extended. This should create a powerful line from your feet through your arm.\n",
      "   - **Coordination:** The core (abdominal muscles) must contract to stabilize the torso while the shoulders and hips align with the directional aim of the arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Final Pose Stabilization:**\n",
      "   - **Dynamic Movement:** Hold the pose in a poised manner, maintaining tension in your arm and steadying your breath for dramatic effect.\n",
      "   - **Coordination:** Ensure that all muscle groups involved—legs for stability, core for posture, and arm/shoulder for maintaining the gunpoint position—are actively engaged to prevent any wavering.\n",
      "Fine Motion Control Evaluation: 1. **Body Trunk:** Rotate the torso quickly to align with the target while maintaining a strong center position.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Left Arm:** Keep the left arm slightly bent at the elbow, positioned to the side for balance without obstructing the dominant arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Right Arm:** Extend the right arm fully and steadily toward the target, keeping the wrist straight and fingers poised as if holding a gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Left Leg:** Bend the left leg slightly to support balance and stability during the turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Right Leg:** Position the right leg firmly, with the foot angled forward to brace the body for the pose.\n",
