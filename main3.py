    Examine the action: "{action}".

    Trajectory control is only necessary if the action includes explicit instructions for movement along a specific two-dimensional path. This typically includes instructions like "turn", "move in a circle", "zigzag", or "change direction", which clearly involve a shift in direction or orientation.

    If an action involves simple movement in a straight line (such as "run forward" or "jump in place") or basic rotations (like "spin in place"), trajectory control is not required because there is no complex or changing path to follow.

    Consider whether the action explicitly requires a change in direction or follows a curved or angular path, then conclude if trajectory control is necessary. If the path is simple or linear, trajectory control is not needed.

    Explain your reasoning step by step and conclude with whether trajectory control is required.
